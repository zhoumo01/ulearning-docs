## Key Points:
- **Super Admin (System Admin Role)**: Have the permissions to do all listed above - an ULearning instance has only one Super Admin. It is fixed and not customizable.
- **Other customized Admin roles**: What they can do will depend on the privileges the Super Admin assigned to them - an ULearning instance can have multiple Admins.
- **System Settings function**: Not accessible to any admins except the Super Admin.
